<dt class="depth0"><a id="term2"></a><H3>Test Set</H3></dt><dd class="depth0"> <p>Test Set is group of test cases that can be used to group test cases together</p>

<dt class="depth0"><a id="term2"></a><H3>Dependency</H3></dt><dd class="depth0"> <p>Dependency for Test Case sets any dependencies for a test case for example Test Case can be dependent on OS for example Windows/Mac/Linux. dependencies are there to organize your test cases and reporting. Think about ?having a test case that can be run on two different os. Example iOS and Android. The end goal for the test case would be same but the steps would be obviously different. Assume iOS testing fails but passes on Android. If you have a single test case for both, your reporting will be all messed up. With our dependency feature, your reporting is automatically taken care of. </p>

<dt class="depth0"><a id="term2"></a><H3>Test Step</H3></dt><dd class="depth0"> <p>Test Case is broken down in to Test Steps. Test Steps can be used for verification of Test Case</p>

<dt class="depth0"><a id="term2"></a><H3>Verification Point</H3></dt><dd class="depth0"> <p>Verification Point is a point in Test Step which determines outcome of a Test Case. f a test case should be considered as failed or blocked. In our system during execution, you don't have to worry about anything. Essentially the test case creator gets all the thinking to do. Executor of the test cases just passes/fails the steps. Our system will automatically take care of it. So, if a test case fails on a verification point, it is a failed test case. If it's not, then it's a blocked. This is because we couldn't get to the steps that decides if the purpose of the test case was fulfilled. You can set multiple verification point. Assume that you have a test case that says do this, this, this and verify this and verify this</p>
