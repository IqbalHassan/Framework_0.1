				<p class = 'Text' style="color: #444444; margin-left: 20;font-family: Arial, Gadget, sans-serif ;font-size: 17px"><a>Back in 2008-2009, we started the initial automation with QTP for PC and Applescrtip/Automator for Mac.   We soon realized that both of those frameworks were not logical to expand based on our needs and there was a lot of redundant work on both platforms. We were lacking a lot of key features that we could not implement with ease. Developers could not properly utilize the work we were doing and both frameworks need large software to be installed along with various other short coming.<br><br>Around 2010, we decided to explore all the automation teams in BlackBerry and see which framework was flexible enough to support on various platform and would require the least effort to automate the Desktop Software/Various Clients/BBOS.  We soon realized that, it would require a lot of work or in many cases not possible to support what we wanted or needed (functional, linguistic testing, and performance testing).  We also had a vision that everything that a tester needs and wants must be accessible easily from a user-friendly interface.<br><br>That is when we decided to build our own framework that would satisfy all our needs for current and future projects. When we built the automation framework, we ensured that it is completely application-independent, easy to expand, maintain, perpetuate and most importantly, users of the framework (testers and developers) do not face any complexity of the framework. We have proven the success of our product by executing the identical framework on both PC and Mac with very little work. BlackBerry Link for both PC and Mac were redesigned along with BBOS to BlackBerry 10, and yet we have put in very little work to support all those changes. Below is a brief list of some of the core features of our framework:</a></p>
